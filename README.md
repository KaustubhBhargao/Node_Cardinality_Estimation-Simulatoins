# Node_Cardinality_Estimation-Simulatoins
This directory contains the simulations performed for the node cardinality estimation schemes proposed in 
"S. Kadam and G. S. Kasbekar, "Node Cardinality Estimation Using a Mobile Base Station in a Heterogeneous Wireless Network Deployed Over a Large Region," 
2020 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM), Bangalore, India, 2020, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/SPCOM50965.2020.9179541."

The new simulations are more generalised and consideres multiple scenarions.
